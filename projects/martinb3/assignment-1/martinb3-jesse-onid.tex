\section{Introduction}
We want to create an ios application that can help college students exchange and acquire their textbooks more easily for classes. This application will provide the user with ways to link their bank account to their phone and then be able to use their money to trade for books or sell their old books. The app would detect other students that have the book that the student would need for their courses for next term and check for pricing ranges and the best deals.

\section{Possible Challenges}

Linking bank accounts would have to be very secure since this is very important information and would undoubtedly be the hardest thing to implement in this particular project.


Textbook price increases~\cite{bookhuff}
Even more textbook increase~\cite{booknbc}
